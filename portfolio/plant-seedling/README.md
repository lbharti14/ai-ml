# üå± Plant Seedling Species Classification - Computer Vision Project

**Course**: Introduction to Computer Vision  
**Objective**:  
Build a deep learning model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to accurately classify plant seedlings into one of **12 species** based on leaf image data. This model will assist in automating agricultural identification processes using computer vision techniques.

## üîç Problem Statement

Identifying plant species at the seedling stage is crucial in modern agriculture. Manual classification is time-consuming and error-prone. The goal of this project is to leverage CNNs to:
- Classify plant seedling images into one of 12 categories
- Improve accuracy of seedling species detection
- Enable real-time and scalable agricultural diagnostics

   - Loaded and resized seedling images
   - Used ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and normalization

2. **Model Building**
   - Designed a custom **CNN architecture** with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers
   - Used ReLU activation and softmax output layer for multiclass classification

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained model on labeled images using categorical cross-entropy loss
   - Applied early stopping and batch normalization

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Achieved **~66% accuracy** on validation set
   - Analyzed performance using classification report and confusion matrix
