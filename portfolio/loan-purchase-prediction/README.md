# 🏦 Personal Loan Campaign - Machine Learning Capstone Project

**Course**: Machine Learning  
**Objective**:  
Identify bank customers who are most likely to purchase a loan product. This project involves analyzing customer data to uncover patterns and characteristics that influence loan acquisition. The insights and predictive model will enable the bank to optimize its marketing strategies and improve loan conversion rates.
